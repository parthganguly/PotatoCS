# Odysseus Desktop

Windows-first desktop MVP for local Odysseus chat, documents, RAG, optional OCR,
and non-destructive legacy import.

Odysseus Desktop is a standalone product fork of the upstream Odysseus project.
It keeps the spirit of a local AI workspace, but it deliberately changes the
delivery model: this is a packaged desktop app, not a Docker/web app.

This app is a Tauri desktop shell with a Rust supervisor, a bundled Python
JSON-RPC sidecar over stdio, profile-local SQLite storage, React/TypeScript UI,
and local model runtime detection for Ollama at `127.0.0.1:11434`.

No Docker is required. No app-internal service binds to `0.0.0.0`. Localhost is
used only for external local runtimes such as Ollama and the Vite dev server.

## Why This Fork Exists

The original Odysseus project is broad: it includes a web UI, Docker-oriented
deployment, server routes, and a much larger assistant surface area. That is a
good shape for the original project, but it is not the right shape for this
fork's goal.

This fork exists because the target product is a Windows-first local desktop
app. A user should be able to install it, launch it from the Start Menu, keep
their data in the normal Windows app-data folder, talk to a local model runtime,
import documents, and quit/relaunch without needing Docker, a web server, or a
manually managed Python environment.

That requirement changes the architecture. The app boundary moves from
browser-to-server into desktop-shell-to-sidecar:

```text
React UI
   |
   v
Tauri / Rust desktop shell
   |
   +-- supervises bundled Python sidecar
   +-- owns profile/app-data paths
   +-- talks JSON-RPC over stdio
   +-- detects local Ollama runtime
   |
   v
Python services
   |
   +-- chat/session/settings
   +-- document import
   +-- RAG/chunking/embeddings
   +-- optional OCR
   +-- legacy import
   |
   v
SQLite profile storage
```

## How It Is Different From Upstream

This is not intended as a drop-in patch to upstream Odysseus. It is a focused
desktop fork with a different product contract.

Key differences:

- Desktop-first instead of web-first.
- Tauri/Rust process supervision instead of a long-running app web server.
- JSON-RPC over stdio instead of app-internal HTTP.
- Bundled embedded Python runtime for packaged Windows builds.
- Profile-local SQLite data under `%APPDATA%`.
- Ollama-first local model runtime detection.
- SQLite + NumPy VectorStore MVP, with the VectorStore boundary preserved for
  future sqlite-vec or LanceDB experiments.
- Optional OCR by detecting local tools such as Tesseract and MuPDF/Poppler.
- Non-destructive import from compatible legacy Odysseus data folders.

Removed from the MVP on purpose:

- Docker deployment
- hidden HTTP services
- tools and agents
- email and calendar
- shell execution surfaces
- Cookbook
- gallery/editor
- full MCP
- Chroma

Those features may still make sense in upstream Odysseus. They are intentionally
out of scope here because the first job of this fork is to prove a reliable
local desktop foundation.

## Philosophy

Odysseus Desktop favors a small durable spine over broad feature parity.

The architecture is intentionally boring in the parts that need to be reliable:

- Rust owns the desktop shell, lifecycle, bundled resources, and process
  supervision.
- Python owns the AI orchestration and document intelligence.
- SQLite owns local memory and restart persistence.
- Ollama owns local model execution.
- Optional native helpers can be added later only when they clearly earn their
  complexity.

The design principle is: prove the desktop foundation first, then add features
only when they fit that foundation.

That is why the MVP is narrow. It is not trying to rebuild every upstream module
inside a desktop wrapper. It is trying to become a dependable local AI workspace
that can be installed, inspected, repaired, and trusted on Windows.

## Screenshots

Screenshots are intentionally documented as part of the product surface. The
current MVP should show these screens when captured from a packaged Windows
build:

- `docs/screenshots/chat-rag-sources.png` - chat with RAG enabled and retrieved
  source chips visible.
- `docs/screenshots/documents-import.png` - document import, indexed status,
  OCR status, and test retrieval.
- `docs/screenshots/legacy-import-report.png` - non-destructive legacy import
  report with imported, skipped, incompatible, and failed entries.
- `docs/screenshots/installer-start-menu.png` - installed app launched from the
  Windows Start Menu.

These screenshots are not committed yet because they should come from a clean
packaged build capture, not a development or automation artifact.

## MVP Scope

Included:

- Basic non-RAG chat.
- Sessions, settings, default profile, and restart persistence.
- `.txt`, `.md`, and extractable `.pdf` document import.
- SQLite + NumPy VectorStore-backed RAG.
- Embedding cache by chunk/content hash.
- Optional OCR for scanned/low-text PDFs when Tesseract plus `pdftoppm` or
  `mutool` are locally installed.
- Non-destructive import from compatible legacy Odysseus data folders.
- Profile-local logs and app data.

Excluded from the MVP:

- Tools, agents, email, calendar, shell, Cookbook, gallery/editor, full MCP,
  Chroma, Docker, and hidden HTTP.

## User Setup

Install the Windows build from:

```powershell
src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Odysseus Desktop_0.1.1_x64-setup.exe
```

The installer includes the app, Python sidecar code, and a bundled embedded
Python runtime with required Python dependencies. A system Python install is not
required to run the installed app.

For local chat, install and run Ollama separately:

```powershell
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.2
```

OCR is optional. To OCR scanned PDFs, install Tesseract and at least one PDF
renderer:

- Tesseract OCR
- MuPDF `mutool`, or Poppler `pdftoppm`

If OCR tools are missing, scanned PDFs remain listed with a clear OCR-unavailable
state. Normal text, Markdown, extractable PDF import, and non-RAG chat still work.

## Data and Logs

User data is stored in the app-data profile folder:

```powershell
%APPDATA%\dev.odysseus.desktop\profiles\default
```

Important files:

- `app.db` - profile-local SQLite database.
- `files\documents` - profile-local copies of imported documents.
- `logs\backend.log` - Python sidecar startup, JSON-RPC errors, Ollama detection,
  document import, OCR, and legacy import logs.

Quit and relaunch should preserve sessions, settings, documents, chunks,
embeddings, OCR pages, and RAG behavior.

## Developer Setup

Install prerequisites:

- Node.js
- Rust and Cargo
- Windows WebView2 runtime
- Optional: Ollama for real chat/RAG smoke testing
- Optional: Tesseract plus `mutool` or `pdftoppm` for real OCR smoke testing

Install Node dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run backend tests:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r python\requirements.txt
python -m pytest python/tests
```

Run local RAG reliability evals against installed Ollama models:

```powershell
python scripts\run_rag_evals.py
python scripts\run_rag_evals.py --models llama3.2 --verify
```

The eval fixtures live under `evals\`. They check required facts, forbidden
claims, required source scoping, and latency without using cloud models.

Run the frontend build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Run the desktop app in development:

```powershell
npm run tauri:dev
```

`tauri:dev` stages the embedded Python runtime first, then starts Tauri. The
development UI uses Vite on `127.0.0.1:1420`.

## Packaging

Stage and verify the embedded Python runtime:

```powershell
npm run prepare:python
npm run verify:python
```

The staged runtime lives in `python-runtime` and is bundled as a Tauri resource.
It must import:

- `json`
- `sqlite3`
- `numpy`
- `pypdf`
- `rpc_server`
- `odysseus_desktop_backend`

Build the Windows installer:

```powershell
npm run tauri:build
```

The NSIS installer is emitted under:

```powershell
src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis
```

Run the smoke gate:

```powershell
npm run smoke
```

To skip re-downloading/revalidating the embedded runtime during repeated local
checks:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\smoke-mvp.ps1 -SkipRuntime
```

The smoke gate covers fresh profile startup, Ollama missing/reachable detection,
basic chat, document import, RAG chat/retrieval, OCR unavailable/available mocked
paths, legacy import reporting, restart persistence, frontend build, and Rust
`cargo check`.
